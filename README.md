# Synthetic-Control-Paper-Model


Data and Methodology Based off of paper here:https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2114226119

Code located in Synthetic Control Paper.ipynb

Main 2 notebooks for process is "Synth_Control_Paper" and "Bayesian_SC". Synth_Control_Paper replicates the existing paper and saves results in the folder RBSC_Replications. Bayesian_SC produces our results and saves samples into the folder Trained_Samples. Also, when toggled to True in the synthetic control function, saves plots to the folder 'figures'. 

Synth_Control_Draft is a messier version of the whole process, notebook used to experiment with new things before adding to other 2 notebooks, but mostly similar.
